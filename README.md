# Shipping Service.

Shipping service is responsible for finding the distance of the package to be shipped and calculate the price based on that. 

Shipping service is written in Java, Hence we need to install Java.

1. Install Maven, This will install Java too 

```
# apt update 
# apt install maven -y 
```

2. As per the standard process, we always run the applications as a normal user.

Create a user 

```
# useradd -m -s /bin/bash roboshop
```

3. Download the repo 

```
$ cd /home/roboshop
$ curl -s -L -o /tmp/shipping.zip "https://github.com/zelar-soft-roboshop/shipping/archive/main.zip"
$ unzip /tmp/shipping.zip
$ mv shipping-main shipping
$ cd shipping
$ mvn clean package 
$ mv target/shipping-1.0.jar shipping.jar 
```
